# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

This is a **single-context** repo: one `CONTEXT.md` and one `docs/adr/`, both at the
`wsn-codegen/` root. There is no `CONTEXT-MAP.md` and no per-package split, because
there are no packages — no workspaces, no `packages/`.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

As of this file's creation, neither exists yet. That is the expected starting state.

## File structure

```
wsn-codegen/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-<decision>.md
│   └── 0002-<decision>.md
└── src/
```

If this ever becomes a multi-package repo, the layout changes to a root
`CONTEXT-MAP.md` pointing at one `CONTEXT.md` per context, with context-scoped
`src/<context>/docs/adr/` beside system-wide `docs/adr/`. Re-run
`/setup-matt-pocock-skills` at that point rather than editing this by hand.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because…_
